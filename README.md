Understanding KNN algorithm 

Try to build the algorithm from scratch

NOTE
KNN (sklear.neighbors)
-	KNN performs better with a lower number of features than many features.
1.	Supervised
- A.	The distance measurement: Euclidean distance (mostly used)
- B.	Application: handwritten digits and satellite image scenes
2.	Unsupervised 
- A.	Algorithm(parameter when using python)
 - i.	BallTree
 - ii.	KDTree
 - iii.	Brute-force
